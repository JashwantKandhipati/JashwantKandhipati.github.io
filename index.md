## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 04, Part-1
    This lab was also fun as it was cool to be able to use the # include math and be able to use the math source files and have the program do
all the calculations for me. Although it was not easy to implement, once my partner and I were able to implement it was really cool to be
able to input any measurement and instantly have it converted into different measurements. 
  
* Lab 07, Part-1

  This one of my favorites as it was very interesting to be able to create a program that can help people avoid getting their car towed when parking.
I noticed that this can be a problem on streets with multiple signs which can get confusing. This lab felt especially interesting because I had faced
a problem when my family and I went to LA for an event. We were trying to park on the street but there were multiple signs on the road, making it confusing
whether we can park there or not. We had ended up looking for another parking spot.

* Lab 11, Part-2

  This was my favorite as it was one of the games that we had made. It was very interesting to be able to make a game although it was very simple.
I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to implement the game class. It was also a little hard to keep track of the guesses left, but once
it was implemented it was easy to understand where I had gone wrong.
