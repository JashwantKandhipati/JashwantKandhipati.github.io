## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 04, Part-1
  
  This lab was enjoyable because it was fascinating to use the #include directive for math and utilize the math source files,
allowing the program to handle all the calculations. Although implementing it was challenging, once my partner and I succeeded,
it was exciting to input any measurement and instantly see it converted into various units.
  
* Lab 07, Part-1

  This was one of my favorite labs because it was fascinating to create a program that could help people avoid getting their cars
towed when parking. I noticed this issue is common on streets with multiple, often confusing signs. This lab felt particularly
meaningful because I had experienced a similar problem when my family and I went to LA for an event. While trying to park on the
street, the numerous signs made it unclear whether parking was allowed, and we ultimately decided to search for another spot.

* Lab 11, Part-2

  This was my favorite lab because it involved creating one of the games we made. Although the game was simple, it was fascinating
to develop it. I had a lot of fun figuring out how to implement the game class. Keeping track of the remaining guesses was a bit
challenging at first, but once it was implemented, it became clear where I had made mistakes.
